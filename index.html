   <p id='a-t'>Google defines history as the study of past events, particularly in human affairs, more specifically, the whole series of past events connected with someone or something. Broadly speaking, history is a shared remembrance of previous events.</p>
   <p id='d-t'>Humans aren't the only species that shared history; certain plants and animals remember the past as well. For example, trees' rings denote the years that the tree was alive. The size and color of the rings also denotes additional information about the year, including rainfall and temperature. The difference is humans are conscious of their knowledge of the whereas animals would have no way of communicating their knowledge of the past collectively.</p>

   <div id='b'><i class='fas fa-pencil-alt'></i><h1>Written History</h1></div>
   <p id='b-t'>When we think of history, we primarily think of written history. Written history is arguably more credible than spoken history, because it is not limited by human memory. This means that written history can survive independently of the people who write it. However, it is important to take historical bias into account when reading history. Historical bias occurs because writers of history were often highly educated, which may not give the most accurate representation of the whole population. Nevertheless, written history is one of the best resources we have for learning about the past.</p>
   <p id='c-t'>However, written history is certainly not the only way to learn of the past, We have oral (or spoken) history as well. Although spoken history is arguably not as credible as written history, it may make up for this by making history like a story. When history is told as a story, it is more enjoyable for some to learn. However, from a purely evidence- based standpoint, it is most likely not the most credible source available.</p>
