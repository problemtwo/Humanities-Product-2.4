			<h1>A definition of the word history</h1>
			<p>Google defines `history` as `the study of past events, particularly in human affairs.`
			In essence, history is a shared memory of the past.</p>

			<h1>How do plants and animals remember the past?</h1>
			<p>Humans aren't the only ones that remember the past:
			plants and animals do it as well. For example, in the case of plants,
			a tree has rings inside of its trunk that take note of the past.
			The size and color of the rings depict seasonal weather, and climatic
			events in the past. However, this isn't exactly `knowledge` of the past,
			because the tree does not actually remember the events. Also, the tree is
			not able to discuss those events with other trees, so this `knowledge` is not shared.
			Animals also remember events in the past, such as where they stashed food for the winter,
			or a place that they used to call home. However, no evidence has suggested that animals
			SHARE this information with members of the same species, which again, shows that humans are
			unique in our ability to collectively learn from the past.</p>
